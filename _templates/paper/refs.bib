@article{Aznarez2022,
   abstract = {Urban green and blue spaces (UGBS) are key for biodiversity conservation. Many studies focus on UGBS benefits for well-being, but how UGBS ecological and quality influence urban biodiversity is still poorly understood. We analysed the predictive accuracy of urban wildness (UW) and habitat quality (HQ) spatial patterns to biodiversity in the city of Vitoria-Gasteiz, Basque Country. Using GIS techniques, we mapped relative UW as a landscape quality, considering remoteness, challenging terrain, and perceived naturalness. We further evaluated HQ using the InVEST habitat quality module, including data on habitat sensitivity to threats (e.g. population density, light and noise pollution, accessibility) and suitability for biodiversity support, based on a parametrization by expert consultation. We compared UW and HQ to observed species richness obtained from crowd-sourced databases as a biodiversity proxy. UW and HQ models predicted general biodiversity urban patterns, being particularly adequate in UGBS. Peripheral UGBS were associated with higher UW and HQ and positively correlated to biodiversity, as opposed to the smaller-sized centrally located UGBS, more exposed to threats. Both predictors significantly explained biodiversity, and HQ better accounted for threat susceptibility in UGBS. Our findings suggest that small-sized UGBS, such as parks and squares, fail to effectively support urban biodiversity, due to their high exposure and vulnerability to threats, particularly in centric areas. Emphasizing efforts in larger centric UGBS with rewilding strategies (e.g. lowering management frequency) and reducing exposure to threats is essential to increase the habitat quality of UGBS and thus support urban biodiversity.},

   abstract = {As one of the most fertile ecosystems on earth, mangrove forests provide many goods and services for humanity. Mangroves are located in the south of Iran on the coasts of Sistan and Baluchistan, Hormozgan and Bushehr provinces, which include two species of Harra (Avicennia marina) and Chandal (Rhizophora mucronata) The purpose of this study was to describe the condition of mangrove forests using the integrated valuation of ecosystem services and tradeoffs (InVEST) between 2010 and 2021 from the southern coasts of Iran. The INVEST model uses land use and land cover maps to estimate habitat quality. With the opinions of local experts, sources of threats, maximum impact distance, state of degradation, and sensitivity to threats were also estimated for each type of land use cover. Urban and rural areas’ development, roads network, piers, oil and non-oil industries, agriculture, and aquaculture activities, were identified as sources that threaten mangroves’ long-term viability. The output maps of the INVEST habitat quality model included degradability and habitat quality maps, which were classified into four categories: poor, low, medium, and high, to better understand quality changes. The results demonstrated that mangrove habitat quality has decreased considerably despite the increase in their area. The area of the target habitats has been increased by 586.45 ha while two first quality categories, including poor and low classes, increased. Based on a habitat quality assessment in 2010, two classes of poor, low habitat quality, were estimated to be around 0.72, and 8.42 ha, which changed to 3.04 ha, and 9.72 ha respectively in 2021. The output maps obtained in this study can help local managers and decision-makers to have an image of what happened to the quality of the target ecosystems and may help them to adopt more effective management strategies for the conservation of these ecosystems.},

@article{Tang2022,
   abstract = {Urbanisation leads to dramatic changes in regional land use, which significantly affects habitat quality. Research on the coupling coordination relationship between urbanisation and habitat quality is conducive to promoting regional ecological environment improvement and urban sustainable development. In this article, we adopted the InVEST model and linear weighted sum method separately to evaluate the spatio-temporal variation characteristics of habitat quality and urbanisation level of the Grand Canal. Then, we used the coupling coordination degree model (CCDM) to investigate the interactive coercing relationship between urbanisation and habitat quality. The purpose was to provide reference for future implementation of ecological conservation work along the Grand Canal and formulation of sustainable urban development strategies. The results showed that habitat quality has continued to decline from 1990 to 2018. After becoming a world cultural heritage site, the habitat quality of the partial reaches has improved. The comprehensive urbanisation level and the four subsystem urbanisation levels, including demographic urbanisation, spatial urbanisation, economic urbanisation, and social urbanisation, of 35 cities along the Grand Canal have all steadily increased from 1990 to 2018. The social urbanisation level was obviously lower than the urbanisation levels of the other three dimensions in most cities along the Grand Canal, indicating that the quality of urbanisation seriously lags behind the speed. The coupling coordination degree (CCD) between the urbanisation level of each city and the habitat quality of the reaches in the corresponding city exhibited a fluctuating but increasing relationship. Most cities have developed in a more coordinated direction and very few cities have deteriorated. Meanwhile, the coupling coordination characteristics between urbanisation level and habitat quality have constantly changed, from the urbanisation lagged type to the urbanisation-habitat synchronised type and the habitat quality lagged type. This article has important value for implementing the ecological conservation and restoration projects of the Grand Canal, optimizing land management policies, and improving the sustainable development level of cities along the Grand Canal.},
